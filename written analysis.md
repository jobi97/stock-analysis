Green Stock Analysis
Overview: In this challenge, we developed tools to analyze stock performance in the field of green energy during the fiscal years of 2017 and 2018. More specifically, our Client Steve was interested in seeing the performance of stock DQ relative to the other green energy stocks in the market.  This would be used as reference to create a pitch to his family, who are his financial backers. This was done by examining the stocks return for the years of 2017 and 2018 in comparison to others.  

Findings: In 2018, DQ's return was down a whopping 62.6%.  Which possibly should make Steve reconsider his plans and go with another company in his investment.  However, if you consider the fact that the returns from the year prior, 2017, were up 199%, it could be argued that the company is well below its peak and there is still plenty of room to grow. The best performers from the beginning of 2017 until the end of 2018 are by far and away ENPH and FSLR, both increasing their returns by ~210%. DQ, when looking at the same time frame, was up 137%.  This places the stock in 4th place in terms of returns during the interval analyzed.  Not bad at all! If Steve's hypothesis is correct, and the company is at its lowest dip, the it would seemingly be a great investment.  


Process: We built out code in a free format to see the speed in which the data could be pulled, and then used a refractored template to see if the info could be pulled faster in this manner. This type of examination is useful for understanding how to organize your code for the future, how to better label the code entered, and does so by visalizing the steps that could be made quicker.  It was proven that the refractored code was 0.03 seconds quicker, coming in at 0.51, while the free code was 0.54. If it was any question which format is best, the programs speed in which it can read the code proves the point best. It is worthwhile to note that there are disadvantages to refractored code.  If done poorly, it may fail the requirement that external functionality not be changed, introduce new bugs, or both.
